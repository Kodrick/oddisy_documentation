Projects in Oddisy are called Universes. They hold all of your entries and stories, and can easily be extended to house multiple stories and all of their encompassing entries.

:::

To create a new universe click the Create New Universe button.

The dialog will ask for a name for your Universe and a name for your default World.

:::info

A World is a special Entry that serves as a place to hold and group entries together. It can be used the same as any other Entry, but has a few extra aspects to it. The vast majority of entries will have an associated World entry.

After creating your new Universe, Oddisy's welcome screen will appear. Click on the Universe to open it and begin editing.
