## Exporting

Oddisy allows you to export your Project, including all of the information you've added to any Entries you've created.
<!-- , to a number of different file types.  -->

<!-- :::info

Oddisy currently supports exporting to text files (.txt), markdown files (.md), and PDF.

You can choose to export to a single large PDF, or a separate PDF for each Entry.

<!-- 
:::note
Creating a PDF can take up a lot of resources, and Oddisy may seem to freeze while the PDF is created. Additionally, you should be aware that creating a single large PDF file for your entire project can potentially create an extremely large PDF. For large projects, it is possible that exporting to a single PDF can cause instability.

## How to Export

Exporting your Project with Oddisy is simple. From the Welcome Screen, simply press the export button on the right side of the Project Card that you wish to export. This will open a dialog prompting you to select the export option you prefer. You can export to an Oddz file, or to text files.
