# Filling Out the Entry Page

The Entry Page is divided into 2 sections: 
* The Top Section includes the name of the Entry, the description and images. You can also delete and pin the entry via the buttons in the top right section. 
* The bottom section includes Fields, Linked Entries, and Groups, which allow you to organize both.

For more information on the Supported Field Types, visit [Entry Fields](../Concepts/entry_fields).

Once created, the field will be added to the page and the value and name can be edited at any time.

## Adding Custom Fields

Custom Fields provide a way to reuse fields across entries. Custom Fields can have a default value that you set yourself. This makes it easy to add similar information across multiple characters, locations, items, or anything else you can imagine.

To add a Custom Field to an entry click the **+** add button next to the fields and groups section, and when the dialog pops up choose Custom Field.

![Entry Page](../../static/img/getting_started/add_to_entry_dialog.JPG)

This will bring up the Custom Field Dialog with all the available custom Fields.

Oddisy comes with some built in Custom Fields that you can use in your entries immediately.

Groups provide a way to organize your Fields and Linked Entries.

To add a Group to an entry, click the **+** add button next to the Fields and Groups section, and when the dialog pops up, choose Group.
