You can switch between the Entry Types via the side bar.

Right now, the only Entry is the World entry that is automatically created when the Project is made. You can view it by switching to the **World** entry type, or by selecting **All** in the Entry Types section of the sidebar.

## Create your First Entry

Let's create a new Character entry to get started. To create a new Character entry, switch to **Character** in the the Entry Types Section of the sidebar, and click on the **ADD CHARACTER** button. 

This will open up the Entry Creation Dialog, which allows you to set the name and add images to the Entry. You will also need to choose a World entry for the new entry to go under.
